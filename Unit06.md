**Unit 6: Cognitive Abilities** <span id="6"></span> 
*This is the first of two units that will look at the practical
applications of gender difference.  This unit will examine cognitive
abilities across the sexes.  While “cognitive abilities” does include
intelligence (and while we will speak about intelligence in this unit),
please note that “cognitive ability” does not refer exclusively to
intelligence.  When we study cognitive abilities, we generally look at
different aspects of how we think and use our mental resources,
including (but certainly not limited to) perception, motivation, spatial
recognition, and memory.  While psychologist has not researched how
gender relates to each of these processes (for some, no correlation can
be found!), there are some notable differences between the genders with
regards to some of these processes.  While many of these studies are
sound, many do not report perfect correlation (i.e. many of the findings
are not true for every woman or every man).  They are instead
generalizations based on what typically occurs.  *

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 12 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 6.1: 4 hours

☐    Subunit 6.2: 4 hours

☐    Subunit 6.3: 4 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this section, students will be able to:

-   Demonstrate an understanding of the commonalities and differences
    between the cognitive abilities of genders.
-   Demonstrate an understanding the gender differences in
    intelligences, including verbal, spatial and mental rotation.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of academic achievement differences
    between genders.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of math and science achievement between
    genders.
-   Demonstrate an understanding gender differences in motivation.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the gender differences in fear of
    failure and success.
