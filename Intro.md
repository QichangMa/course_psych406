Course Syllabus for "PSYCH406: Gender and Sexuality"
----------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to the psychology behind gender and
sexuality, or the study of the different ways our gender roles and
sexual identities impact our lives. Although the terms “gender” and
“sex” are often used synonymously in everyday speech, this course will
assign the terms two different meanings. “Sex” refers to biological
difference—i.e. whether you are a female or male from a biological
standpoint. “Gender” refers to the social and psychological attributes
that come along with one’s sex. Though these terms are similar and
relate to one another, there is a distinct difference between the two
that you should recognize for the purposes of this course. In this
course, we will take a look at how our understanding of our own gender
and sex can affect different aspects of our functioning, while also
identifying the factors in our lives that can impact our gender and sex.
While we often assume we know a lot about how gender affects our lives
and the lives of the opposite gender, these assumptions usually turn out
to be incorrect. Gender and, to a lesser extent, sex are complex
concepts that involve a number of different processes. An individual’s
gender identity can be impacted by large-scale processes like evolution,
learning theory, biology, and social influence—just to name just a few.
A person’s gender identity can determine or play a significant role in
many aspects of that person’s life, from his or her personality and
cognitive abilities to the way he or she interacts with other people.
While some of these topics fall outside the scope of this course, they
should demonstrate that many factors can influence gender and that
gender and sexuality can influence many features of our lives. This
course will begin by introducing and defining the concepts of gender and
sexuality in order to familiarize you with some of the terms and
theories that will be used throughout the remaining units. We will then
take a look at the similarities and differences between sexes in terms
of biological and neurological functioning and development. We will also
take a look at how sexual and gender identities play a role in our
lives. Subsequently, we will have two units on the different theories
that seek to explain why and how the sexes are different from a
psychological standpoint. The final two units of this course will ask
how gender and sexuality affect two practical areas of our lives: our
cognitive abilities and aggression. Please note that while this course
may touch upon some stereotypes, the goal is to simply apprise you of
the range of theories that have been developed and the research that has
been conducted in order to explain sexual difference.
