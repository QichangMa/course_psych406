**Unit 5: Social Learning and Cognitive Developmental Approaches** <span
id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, we will explore social learning theory and cognitive
development approaches to gender and sex.  Both social learning and
cognitive development theories are popular in and relate to many areas
of psychology.  Accordingly, some of this unit may be a review as we
will first explain the broad theories before relating them directly to
gender and sex studies.  During the development section of this unit,
keep the biological development processes we discussed earlier in mind;
this may help you understand how the process of cognitive and
development and why the process is different for the two sexes.*
