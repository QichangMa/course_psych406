**Unit 3: Sexuality and Gender Identity** <span id="3"></span> 
*In the past few units, we have identified sex as the physical and
biological characteristics of being either male or female.  We will now
learn that gender identity refers to the individual’s experience of
being either male or female.  Please note that typically, one’s
biological sex aligns with his or her gender identity as well—though
there are cases in which the two differ. *  
  
 *Both sexual identity and gender identity are typically understood in
terms of differences.  That is, female gender identity is understood in
terms of the ways in which it is different from male gender identity,
and vice versa.  The goal of this unit is to explain and outline the
different ways our sexual and gender identities can impact our lives.*
