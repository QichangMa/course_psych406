**Unit 4: Sociobiological and Psychoanalytic Approaches** <span
id="4"></span> 
*We will now take a look at sociobiological and psychoanalytic
approaches to gender.  While these approaches are independently useful
for explaining certain aspects of gender and sex, no single approach can
explain everything or serve as an all-encompassing guide to gender and
sexuality.  Certain theories may have more research, while others have
less.  In many cases, approaches change as new research emerges and new
conclusions are formed. *
