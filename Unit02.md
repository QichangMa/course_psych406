**Unit 2: Biology and the Brain** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to the biological and neurological
similarities and differences between men and women.  It will attempt to
explain some of the ways that the physical differences between men and
women affect functioning.  This unit will focus on sex, or the physical
characteristics of being male or female, rather than gender.  While a
background in biology is not necessary, you may wish to review your
notes from past biology courses or refer to ancillary materials on the
subject. *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 20 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 2.1: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 2.2: 3 hours

☐    Subunit 2.3: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 2.4: 3 hours

☐    Subunit 2.5: 3 hours

☐    Subunit 2.6: 5 hours

☐    Subunit 2.7: 2 hours

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this section, students will be able to:

-   Demonstrate an understanding of the biologically based
    characteristics, including differences and similarities, between
    genders.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the biological determinates of sex.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of chromosomal and gonadal sex.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of internal and external genitalia,
    both male and female.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the gender based brain differences
    and similarities.
