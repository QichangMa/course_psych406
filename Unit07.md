**Unit 7: Aggression** <span id="7"></span> 
*Our final unit in this course will examine gender differences in
aggression.  Aggression is a particularly interesting concept in the
study of gender and sex, as it was once primarily thought of as a
masculine ideal.  The notion was that, from an evolution perspective,
aggression was important for males, but not as important for females,
and it therefore became a masculine trait.  However, research has found
that this is not the case.  We will take a close look at much of this
research in this unit. *  
  
 *Please note that this unit does not intend to suggest that there are
no differences between the sexes in terms of aggression, but that those
differences are less prominent than one might assume. *
